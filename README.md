## Dumb Question..... 

Quite often, people start their question with either a `dumb` question or a `stupid` question

As a tech worker, this is something that you'll hear all the time in front of a question. 
The only stupid question is one that never gets asked, regardless of whether you might think it is a dumb or stupid question.

Most questions about technology are asked for one of a few reasons:

1. Acquiring knowledge.
2. Reaffirm your understanding of something.
3. To ask for clarification because an explanation was unclear

### Here's my take on it

Give yourself some credit for asking the question in the first place. Particularly if you do it online or in person. The question you wish to ask is very likely one that others would also like answered, but are afraid to do so because they think it's a stupid question.

So ask away! Every question is a great question and one that needs answering!
