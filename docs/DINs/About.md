# DINs

I expect there likely may not be any DINs for this project.

But if you want to you can write 1 or more DIN/s and add it under this folder & you must add your DIN/s in the DINs folder and in a folder of your own using your username for the folder name. This is because we will add you as a codeowner to that folder, ensuring you get notified of any changes that others may makke of your contributions

For more info bout DINS as well as INNs and FINs see the [IINs, DINs & FINs](https://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes?tab=readme-ov-file#iins-dins--fins) as part of [the docTypes repo](https://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes) or the [Announcing: The Interaction Notes Family](https://blog.kilasuit.org/2025/04/30/announcing-iins-dins-fins/) blog post.
