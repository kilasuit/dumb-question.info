# Contributing process

Prior to a PR, we perfer an issue is raised, even for minor seplling mistakes.
This is becuase we use issue templates in this repository and allows for tracking work better by being able to link a PR to an issue using the `fixes #` syntax

Also this is a good way for teaching the links between code, its issues, and fixing those issues.
