# IINs

I expect there will be many IINs for this project & as such you can write 1 or more IIN/s and add it under this folder & you must add your IIN/s in the IINs folder and in a folder of your own using your username for the folder name. This is because we will add you as a codeowner to that folder, ensuring you get notified of any changes that others may makke of your contributions.

However do feel free to leave me one, particulary if you have looked at  or worked with this project.

For more info bout IINS as well as DINs and FINs see the [IINs, DINs & FINs](https://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes?tab=readme-ov-file#iins-dins--fins) as part of [the docTypes repo](https://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes) or the [Announcing: The Interaction Notes Family](https://blog.kilasuit.org/2025/04/30/announcing-iins-dins-fins/) blog post.
