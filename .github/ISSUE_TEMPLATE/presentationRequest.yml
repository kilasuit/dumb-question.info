      I have this Contact Form : https://blog.kilasuit.com/contact-me 
      If you use this, then submit this issue (to get the Issue number), 
      then the form (as it requires a link to the issue)

      If you filled that out, just put "I've filled out the contact form" here.

      However, I would prefer if you could send me a PGP encrypted message pasted here.
      My Current PGP key is on my github profile readme. 

      Don't know about PGP & want me to walk through PGP with you?
      Use the contact form and we can set up a time to chat about it.
